My motivation in joining the bootcamp is to change career
as soon as posible using the skills learned in the bootcamp.

I have been in the BPO industry for 8 years. I have experience
in customer service, sales support and technical support.
I was with Sykes inc for 4 years handling AT&T, and then
transfered to Amazon Inc captive site in Cebu for 2 years, and most recently
I was with TDCX inc. with project Fruit handling the top
manufacturer of mobile phones.
